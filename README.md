  Brief Overview 
                 - This website uses a free Lord Of The Rings API that contains various information related to the movies, books, and characters. I have created this site to be                    an overview example of different skills that i have learned up to this point. The site allows you to view book, movie and character information wihtout having                    a profile. There is also a feature where you can search for specific characters by name and see their quotes. You are also able to sign up for a profile and                      log in. Once you are logged in, you are able to add top 3 favorite characters and movies to your profile, add a bio and a post. You will be able to see a                        difference on the characters page and the movies page. There will be buttons that appear that allow you to add favorites that would not be visible if you were                    not logged in. Any post you add will be visible on your profile as well as the main feed page where all other related posts by different users will appear.                      You are also able to use the edit profile button to edit your name, username, bio and password. The password is setup utalizing Bcrypt to encrypt the password                    for saftey. When the user has finished they are able to succesfully log out.
 
 
Reasoning For Multiple Languages
                 - The wesbite utalizes a mix match of langues and frameworks. The purpose for this was to demonstrate my understanding of these. The purpose was to show how I                      am able to utalize each of these on their own and together. I hose to show you how I am able to use Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML to style a webpage. I initially                      used both Python and vanilla Javacriipt to handle the API, but changed it to only Python handling the requests. I left one javascript API included within the                    characters.js file. This code has been commented out but was left to deomsntrate understanding of ajax request. The webstie has also been pushed to heroku,                      the following link is to the active heroku site. http://lotr-fanpage.herokuapp.com/
